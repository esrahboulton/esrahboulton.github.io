      <p>I'm a front-end developer and accessibility (sometimes abbreviated to "a11y") advocate based in Victoria, British Columbia. I build accessible, responsive, and scalable Drupal and WordPress websites.</p>
      <h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
      <p>Currently I'm the <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> Director at <a href="https://upanup.com">Upanup</a> where I lead a team of Designers and Developers. I've been an accessibility advocate within the company, and strive to make our projects accessible for all people. I joined Upanup in 2015 as Web Production Designer and quickly moved into the role of Developer (in which I stayed for several years). In 2021 I became Development Lead for the front-end team before taking on my current role in early 2023.</p>
      <p><p>Previously I worked for <a href="https://www.chargesolar.com/">Charge Solar</a> (formerly <abbr title="Home Energy Solutions Photovoltaic">HES PV</abbr>) as a Web Designer/Developer.</p>
      <p>I've done freelance work for over a decade, including working for <a href="https://massvelocity.ca/">Mass Velocity Media</a> where I made some back-end changes for <a href="http://teganandsara.com/">Tegan and Sara</a> and built a front-end theme for the Rifflandia music festival.</p>
      <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
      <p>I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Professional Communication from Royal Roads University, and a diploma in Applied Communication from Camosun College.</p>
