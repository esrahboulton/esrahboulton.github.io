      <p>I'm a front-end developer based in Victoria, British Columbia. I build accessible, responsive, and scalable Drupal and WordPress websites.</p>
      <p>Currently I'm the <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> Director at <a href="https://upanup.com">Upanup</a> where I lead a team of Designers and Developers. I've been an accessibility (sometimes abbreviated to "a11y") advocate within the company, and strive to make our projects accessible for all users.</p>
      <p>Previously I worked for <a href="https://www.chargesolar.com/">Charge Solar</a> (formerly <abbr title="Home Energy Solutions Photovoltaic">HES PV</abbr>) as a Web Designer/Developer.</p>
      <p>I maintain a small number of freelance clients, and have worked for <a href="https://massvelocity.ca/">Mass Velocity Media</a> where I made some back-end changes for <a href="http://teganandsara.com/">Tegan and Sara</a> and built a front-end theme for the Rifflandia music festival.</p>
      <p>I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Professional Communication from Royal Roads University, and a diploma in Applied Communication from Camosun College.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in building a new website, or are looking to make improvements to an existing one, you can contact me at esrah.boulton@gmail.com.</p>
